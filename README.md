## C-Vac/peepee: A Pythonic Solution for Enhanced GitHub Activity Visualization

In the realm of software development, GitHub has emerged as the quintessential platform for collaborative coding and version control.  While its core functionality centers on code management, GitHub also provides a visual representation of a user's commit history through the activity graph.  This graph, while informative, often lacks artistic flair and personalization.

This Python script addresses this aesthetic deficiency by enabling users to craft creative patterns on their GitHub activity graph.  Specifically, the script modifies the system time environment variable and generates git commits strategically to render artistic representations, such as anatomically accurate depictions of the male genitalia, on the activity graph.

### **Key Features:**

* **Temporal Manipulation:**  The script deftly manipulates the system time environment variable, allowing for precise control over the timestamps of git commits.  This temporal manipulation is crucial for creating intricate patterns on the activity graph.
* **Anatomical Accuracy:**  The script employs sophisticated algorithms to generate git commits that, when visualized on the activity graph, form anatomically accurate representations of the male genitalia.  This attention to detail ensures the artistic integrity of the generated patterns.
* **Git Integration:**  The script seamlessly integrates with Git, leveraging its core functionalities to create and manage commits.  This integration ensures compatibility with existing Git workflows.
* **User-Friendly Interface:**  The script provides a straightforward command-line interface, enabling users to easily specify the desired pattern and initiate the commit generation process.  This user-friendly design promotes accessibility for developers of all skill levels.
* **Extensible Architecture:**  The modular architecture of the script allows for future enhancements and extensions.  Additional artistic patterns and advanced customization options can be readily incorporated to cater to diverse aesthetic preferences.

This script empowers developers to transcend the mundane limitations of the GitHub activity graph, transforming it into a canvas for creative expression.  By strategically manipulating commit timestamps, users can craft personalized patterns that reflect their unique artistic vision.

### **Installation and Deployment:**

1.  **Clone and Execute:** Clone the repository and execute the `penis.py` script to initiate the script and modify your system time and git commit history.

**Community and Contributions:**
